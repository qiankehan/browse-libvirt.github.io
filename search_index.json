\nVirtualBox, \nLXC, \nBHyve, \nIBM PowerVM, \nMicrosoft Hyper-V\nManage host resources: \nstorages, \nnetworks, \nhost node devices, \nnetwork filters, \nhost interfaces\n\nPreparation to review the code\nDownload the code\nUse git to download libvirt source code.  \ngit clone git://libvirt.org/libvirt.git\n\nLearn git\nGit is powerful version-control system for tracking changes in source code. \nThe following git sub-commands are useful for browsing the code.\ngit log\nGit log is to show the commits history of the source code.Run it directly in the source code directory then get the commits from the last to the first:\ngit log\n\nBy format strings, you can set the format of commits log. This link \ngives the full format or git log.\nFor example, see the commit hash, author, author date, commit subject:\ngit log --pretty=\"format:%H %an %aD %s\"\n\nAnd it can get the commits from one to another:\ngit log COMMIT1..COMMIT2\n\nBy using tags, you can find the commits during two versions. For example, the \nfollowing command will show the commits between version v4.5.0 to v4.6.0 :\ngit log v4.5.0..v4.6.0\n\nMan page: git log\ngit tag\nTags are ref's that point to specific points in Git history.  Tagging is generally \nused to capture a point in history that is used for a marked version release (i.e. v1.0.1).Run as following in source code dir to show all the tags:\ngit tag\n\n--contains is to show which tags contains a specific commit:\ngit tag --contains COMMIT\n\nMan page: git tag\ngit show\nGit show can check the detailed changes of commits.To show the latest code change of a commit:\ngit show\n\nShow code change of specific commit:\nMan page: git show\nvim plugins\nfugitive.vim\nfugitive.vim is a nice git wrapper of vim.You can use pathogen.vim or Vundle.vim\n to install it.See chapter Practice, how to use vim&git to find which software versions contain \nthe code of a specific line.\n\n\n\n\n\n\ngraphname\n\n\na\n\na\n\n\nb\n\nb\n\n\na--b\n\n\n\nc\n\nc\n\n\nb--c\n\n\n\nd\n\nd\n\n\nb--d\n\n\n\n\n\n"},"how-build-libvirt.html":{"url":"how-build-libvirt.html","title":"How to Build Libvirt","keywords":"","body":"TreeviewCopyright © aleen42 all right reserved, powered by aleen42\nHow to build libvirt\n\nInstall dependencies\n\nFor Fedora/Centos\nFor Debian/Ubuntu\n\nDownload the code\nConfiguration\nMake\nInstallation\nBuild by build system of distributions\n\n\n\n\nHow to build libvirt\nInstall dependencies\nMake source repository is configurated.  \nFor Fedora/Centos\nInstall dependencies via dnf builddep:\ndnf builddep libvirt -y\n\nFor earlier fedora/centos, install yum-utils first and then install \ndependencies via yum-builddep:\nyum install yum-utils -y && yum-builddep libvirt -y\n\nFor Debian/Ubuntu\nInstall dependencies by apt build-dep:\napt build-dep libvirt0 -y\n\nDownload the code\nAccording to libvirt download page, \ndownload your preferred libvirt version at https://libvirt.org/sources/ .
